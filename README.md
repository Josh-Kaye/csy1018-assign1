//Commit "first commit"
"first commit" This is my first commit, to set up all the content within the directory folder and push it to my git repo.



//Commit "update 001"
In this commit I coded all of the navigation and container one, I decided to use a a:hover before and after to the navigation bar in order to give it a nice rain drop effect making the animation flow much better than your standard fade. In the next commit I will be completing the positioning and also the footer. I'm currently having problems with the @medias so hopefully that will be updated within the next commit.
